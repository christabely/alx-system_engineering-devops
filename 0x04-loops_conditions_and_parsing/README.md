This is an Alx engineering task on solution to loops, conditions and parsing of variables.

To solve question zero, use the command below to generate your private and public key.

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<your_email>"

It will generate two keys;
A private key called 0-RSA_public_key.pub
Public key called 0-RSA_public_key.pub.pub

Rename the private key 
0-RSA_private_key.pem

Rename the public key 
0-RSA_public_key.pub

Git add, commit, push
Then open the 0-RSA_public_key.pub file on github and update your alx intranet profile with the public SSH key.  Save. 

Then create a Google document and save your private key and your passphrase inside it and check your code.
